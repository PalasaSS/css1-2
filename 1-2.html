            <h2 id="h2-2">The Magic of Glowing Creatures</h2>

            <p id="animalsp">Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is <br> called bioluminescence. It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their <br> bodies creates light. It’s like nature’s version of neon lights!</p> <br>
            
            <h3 id="h3-1">Here’s how it works:</h3>
            
            <p id="p2">1. A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.</p>
            <p id="p2">2. An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.</p>
            <p id="p2">3. Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat  it’s called “cold light.”</p>
